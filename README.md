# Exercise about props

## 1 : Get your props together

- The `Profile` component is missing the props (data) it'll send to `ProfileCard`, please define it
- Once `Profile` sends data, you should think about how `ProfileData` is going to get it

<summary>Hint ? </summary>
<br>
Every `ProfileCard` needs a name, a firstNae, an address and a text for it's button
</details>

## 2: Bonus

In the CSS files, you'll find classes asociated with colors.

- Try to change the text and the button's color using props

## 3: Hyper-Bonus

- Try to display the button **only** when a specific props (let's say... `displayButton` ?) is sent from `Profile`
